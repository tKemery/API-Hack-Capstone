# Brewery-Locator 

An app that helps you find breweries across America.  Ideal for travelers and passers-through, or for those who just want to support their local brewers and find new hangouts. Users can enter a location to see its breweries, and furthermore, filter those breweries by type and see the breweries' Yelp ratings.

## Motivation

I wanted to make an app that accessed multiple APIs to bring something useful to users. I also enjoy trying new beers.
